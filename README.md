# channelshifter_II

written for changing the hostapd.conf 
file where ever it is located with parametrizing. If the SSID and Passphrase are null then it reads before the existing file and 
does not changes the ssid and passphrease, when passphrase and ssid are given it changes both!!
for use with Raspberry PI and Hostapd!!! on Raspbian Buster
